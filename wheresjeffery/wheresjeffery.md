# Where's Jeffery?

From one of the instagram posts, we knew Jeffery had replied to a message with a reference to a Snapchat account:

From here, we went to:
```

```
And had access to his snapcode:

We created a snapchat account, scanned the snapcode on mobile, and did get added right away. 

Originally we tried sending Jeffery messages, but received a sticker telling us to "go away" as he only talks to his real friends.

However, when we realised Snapchat had a map with friends' locations, we could see he was in Dee Why.

NOTE: Unfortunately, we did not get screenshots on mobile (and could not retrospectively access the snap map).
