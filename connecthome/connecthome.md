This challenge was very simple, and was required to have access to the rest of the 'Hack the CISO' challenges. It is more of a tutorial to gain access to the CISO network through a VPN, rather than a challenge.

The flag for this challenge is the IP address given in the challenge description, written in the flag's format.
