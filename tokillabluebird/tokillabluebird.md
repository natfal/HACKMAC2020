# First Day at Uni!

We knew it was likely that Jeffery wouldn't only have an instagram page, and so we checked twitter right away. We tried:
```
https://twitter.com/j3ff3ryth3r3f3r33/
```
which gave us no results.

However, by looking up `j3ff3ryth3r3f3r33` in the Twitter search bar, we got this page:

A quick look at his followers shows the majority of pages are related to basketball:

Hence we presumed it is likely he plays basketball.

NOTE: A google search for 'Blue Bird' didn't reveal anything particularly insightful, and to this day, I'm not too sure on its relation to the challenge (although I believe it is possible it could have been a hint).
